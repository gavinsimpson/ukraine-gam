# Generalized Additive Models in R

## A workshop on GAMs to support Ukraine

## April 13th, 2023, 1800&ndash;2000 CET

## About the workshop

Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) were introduced as an extension to linear and generalized linear models, where the relationships between the response and covariates are not specified up-front by the analyst but are learned from the data themselves. This learning is achieved by representing the effect of a covariate on the response as a smooth function, rather than following a fixed form (linear, quadratic, etc). GAMs are a large and flexible class of models that are widely used in applied research because of their flexibility and interpretability.

The workshop will explain what a GAM is and how penalized splines and automatic smoothness selection methods work, before focusing on the practical aspects of fitting GAMs to data using the [mgcv R package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mgcv), and will be most useful to people who already have some familiarity with linear and generalized linear models.

## About the instructor

Gavin is a statistical ecologist and freshwater ecologist/palaeoecologist. He has a B.Sc. in Environmental Geography and a Ph.D. in Geography from University College London (UCL), UK. After submitting his Ph.D. thesis in 2001, Gavin worked as an environmental consultant and research scientist in the Department of Geography, UCL, before moving, in 2013, to a research position at the Institute of Environmental Change and Society, University of Regina, Canada. Gavin moved back to Europe in 2021 and is now Assistant Professor of Applied Statistics in the Department of Animal and Veterinary Sciences at Aarhus University, Denmark. Gavin's research broadly concerns how populations and ecosystems change over time and respond to disturbance, at time scales from minutes and hours, to centuries and millennia. Gavin has developed several R packages, including gratia, analogue, and cocorresp, he helps maintain the vegan package, and can often be found answering R- and GAM-related questions on StackOverflow and CrossValidated.
